This repository contains many of the coding projects I completed while 
doing the data science path on Codecademy.com.  

This course included introductions into SQL, general python syntax (with 
which I was familiar, but it was a nice refresher), pandas, matplotlib 
(add others later once I'm further along in the course.

The classes also brought me in contact with several concepts that I had 
heard of, but was not completely proficient in until taking the courses
Namely, these topics were Data Cleaning in Pandas and how to use Git and
Github effectively. I did not reach the Git 'sidebar' immediately, and 
that's why many of the projects from the first third of the course are
not included in this repository.
